# dbt_cosmos_diff_folder

This repository shows the sample setup for configuring the DBT cosmos, with the Astro project in one folder and DBT in another.

The Astro project must still be initialised from the 'astro' folder.

Please update the paths in the docker files in the Astro project based on your local paths.
